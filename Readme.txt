This is a website I made for ‘Darnley House’, a heritage listed building in Adelaide, Australia. This was a creative project for me where I was able to practice some of the basic HTML and CSS skills I learnt in my study, as well as an opportunity to practice web design and basic graphic design skills too. 

I wanted to keep the whole project very simple and code everything myself, rather than using any templates or libraries. I wanted to be creative and test the new (basic) skills I learnt in TAFE in 2017 and really understand the fundamentals of web design. I thought this would be a good opportunity to make something from scratch, because the design idea I had was very simple and a static page was suitable for the project. It is designed to be a page where people can find out more information about the history of the building and view photos. 

I made the majority of the page in July 2017 when I was first learning HTML/CSS. I have just completed it in April since I had all the photos I needed. The photos were taken in late 2017 and early 2018, by a professional photographer as well as myself. This was a fun opportunity to learn more about photography and editing too.

I made the wireframes and designed the logo using Adobe Illustrator. I then chose the fonts from the main text from Google Fonts. All fonts used are open licence. The design is simple and elegant and suits the feel of the house. I created the four HTML pages and styled them using CSS. Although it’s simple, it had the look I desired. It isn’t fully responsive (as I really wanted to avoid using anyone else’s code), but I made it flexible enough that it looks good at different browser sizes. I had initially considered using JavaScript to animate the photo gallery but decided to keep it static for now, as I really wanted this to be my own work. Instead, I created an Instagram account to share photos too, which is linked to the page (@darnleyhouse).
